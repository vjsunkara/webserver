             <p> I have extensive knowledge and expertise in Email Architecture, Message Transfer Agent (MTA), PGP, ZIP, SKs, and IDEA. I have also recognized the increasing need for Network Level Security payment gateway for web applications.</p>
             <p>expertise in SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) provides a standard security protocol that enables encrypted links between a web server and a browser in online communication. With SSL technology, I ensure that all data transmitted between the web server and browser remains encrypted, and confidentiality, integrity, and availability are maintained.</p>
             <p>I am also proficient in IPsec Policies, where I can implement security requests for all IP-based traffic and ensure secure communication. My experience in TCP applications allows me to apply these policies to all traffic and transfer them over a secure connection.</p>
             <p>my skills in these technologies and their features, I can provide ease in doing business with new online entities, ensure secure communication, and build a robust security framework for web applications. I am confident that my knowledge and experience in these areas will be a valuable asset to any organization.             </p>
